<p>The Lemur AI project involves designing and implementing an artificial intelligence system for playing the classic board game Battleship. The game is played on a grid where each player places their fleet of ships and attempts to sink the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their locations.
The AI system is designed to play against human opponents, providing a challenging and engaging gameplay experience. The system is a combination of rule-based methods and machine learning algorithms to make intelligent decisions about where to place ships and where to make guesses on the opponent's board.
The system will be developed using Python programming language, and will involve building a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries such as Pygame. The system will have different difficulty levels, ranging from easy to hard, with increasing levels of complexity and strategy involved in the AI's decision-making process.</p>
